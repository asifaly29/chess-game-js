## 🧠 Development Process
The project was built using a **logic-first approach**.  

1. I analyzed chess piece movement rules, starting with the **rook**.  
2. Wrote the movement algorithm on paper:
   - Board coordinate system  
   - Directional movement (horizontal & vertical for rook)  
   - Path obstruction detection  
   - Capture conditions  
3. Once the algorithm was clear, I implemented it in JavaScript.  
4. Gradually added other pieces and interactive features to the board.

This approach helped ensure **accuracy and modularity** before integrating all pieces.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Add **check/checkmate detection**
- Implement advanced rules: **castling** 
- Enhance UI
